This example is a work in progress.

1. Need to make x-direction the "vertical" direction to check that stabilization 
   is working correctly (i.e. the results should be the same as the z-direction, 
   just rotated). Stated down this road, but it's not working yet.

2. We can't seem to get this rolling the direction we want (inside to out). Bob
   thinks this might be due to vertical symmetry in the Boussinesq approximation,
   e.g. the equations can't tell a difference between a negative density 
   fluctuation with a postive g vs. positive fluctuation and negative g. This needs
   further investigating.
